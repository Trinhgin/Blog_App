# Blog_App
Create a blogging application that allows users to do the following:
- register an account
- login
- logout

Once logged in, a user should be able to:
- create a post
- view a list of their own posts
- view a list of everyone's posts
- view a specific post, including the comments people have made about it
- leave a comment on a post
- add encryption to the blog so that the user's passwords are stored safely. Do this in a new branch called "encryption"
- add validation such that the user registration and login routes behave like modern web applications. Make sure to put the validation on both the client and the server. 
- the username field cannot be empty and must be unique  
- the password field cannot be empty and must contain at least 8 characters
- for registration, the 'confirm password' and 'password' fields must match each other
